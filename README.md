This healthcare-based application is developed using Java, following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It leverages JDBC, MySQL, and Maven for efficient database interaction and project management.

The system organizes patient-related data through dedicated modules for Patients, Doctors, Medical History, Treatment Plans, and Appointments, supporting core operations such as add, update, view, and delete.

Designed with modularity and scalability in mind, the project is well-suited for real-world healthcare environments.
